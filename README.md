## Git

### What is git?  
Git is a [distributed version-control][g-1] system for tracking changes in [source code][g-2] during [software development][g-3]. It is designed for coordinating work among [programmers][g-4], but it can be used to track changes in any set of [files][g-5]. Its goals include speed, [data integrity][g-6], and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Read more on [wikipedia][g-7]

### Why do we use Git / GitHub?  
We use GitHub for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.
